## JSON schemas and examples

This directory is to work with the [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/) gang on using ValueFlows vocabulary to experiment with creating an economic layer on top of the ssb gossip network, using ssb messages.  

The schemas and examples here are not meant to be definitive, and in some cases have short-cut the VF vocabulary to create smaller scoped examples to try out.  It is all experimental, and tailored to this experiment right now.
