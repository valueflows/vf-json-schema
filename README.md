# vf-json-schema
json-schema reference for ValueFlows vocabulary

Updated for the VF .4 release, 2019/10.

**NOTE: These schemas are slightly behind the VF core spec, have a couple known discrepancies, and have not yet been tested in a real project.  If you want to use json-schemas for your work, please start an issue in this repo, and we will bring the json-schemas into a better state; and also work with you to make corrections as you start to use them.  Thanks!**
